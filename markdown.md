Absolutely! Designing a program that evolves over time is an excellent approach to avoid plateaus and keep your workouts engaging. We can create a plan with phases, where each phase lasts about 4 weeks. Here's how it might look:

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4):**
- **Strength & Foundation Building:** Focus on core compound movements, like deadlifts, squats, and bench presses.
- **Flexibility Training:** Basic stretching and mobility work tailored to Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8):**
- **Progressive Overload:** Increase intensity by adding weights or changing rep schemes.
- **Variation in Exercises:** Introduce new exercises that target the same muscle groups but offer variety.
- **Advanced Flexibility Training:** Incorporate more advanced stretching techniques to continue improving flexibility.

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12):**
- **Power & Performance Focus:** Emphasize exercises that build explosive power, using plyometrics or other techniques.
- **Calisthenics & Body Weight:** Incorporate more calisthenic exercises for a well-rounded approach.
- **Recovery Focus:** Implement specific recovery strategies to ensure continued progress without overtraining.

After these 12 weeks, we can evaluate your progress and either continue with a similar rotation or introduce entirely new strategies based on your needs and progress.

I'll get started on detailing these phases, including the specific exercises, sets, reps, and nutritional guidance for each phase. Feel free to reach out during any phase for adjustments or further assistance!

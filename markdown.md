Great questions! Your approach to weight selection will depend on your existing strength and your goals for the phase. Since Phase 1 is about building strength and foundation, here's how you might approach it:

**Deadlifts (and other exercises):**
- **Initial Weight Selection:** Start with a weight that's around 70-75% of your estimated 1-rep max (1RM) for 6-8 reps. This weight should be challenging but not maximal, allowing you to focus on form and technique.
- **Progression:** If you successfully complete 3 sets of 8 reps at a given weight, you can consider increasing the weight by around 2.5% to 5% for the next session. So, if you lifted 70kg, you might go up to 72-74kg next time.
- **Same Weight Across Sets:** Aim to use the same weight across all sets, but it's okay to adjust if needed. If the weight feels too light or heavy, you can modify it for the subsequent sets.
- **Warm-Up Sets:** Before your working sets, do 1-2 warm-up sets with lighter weights to prepare your muscles. This can be something like 50% of your working set weight for 8 reps, followed by 60% for 6 reps.

**Example for Deadlifts:**
- Warm-up set 1: 50% of working set weight x 8 reps
- Warm-up set 2: 60% of working set weight x 6 reps
- Working set 1: 70kg x 8 reps
- Working set 2: 70kg x 8 reps
- Working set 3: 70kg x 8 reps
- (If successful with all 8 reps for 3 sets, consider increasing to 72-74kg next session)

The goal in this phase is steady progress without pushing to failure. Focus on consistency, proper form, and gradually increasing the weight as you become more comfortable. Make sure to listen to your body and make adjustments as needed. If something feels too easy or too challenging, don't hesitate to modify the weights.

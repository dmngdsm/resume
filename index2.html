            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>My career started 7 years ago as a copywriter for Leo Burnett Bulgaria where I was given a huge responsibility for a 21 years old - I was leading the whole ATL/BTL communication strategy for Diageo’s Johnnie Walker brand for three years. My favorite trophy from that time is Diageo’s Marketing Brilliance Award for Best Integrated Campaign Agency for 2012. <br><br>

            In 2013 I was invited to Benetton’s Fabrica Institute where I spent two weeks and contributed to Fabrica’s Colors magazine “Moving House” issue. <br><br>

            In 2014 I spent an year as a senior copywriter/general creative consultant at one of top 3 Bulgarian creative agencies - All Channels Communication Group, a FleishmanHillard Affiliate. I am proud of that period because I spent the year working really hard and the results proved it - we delivered successful campaigns for many clients and won a prestigious award at the Bulgarian Advertising Awards ceremony. <br><br>

            I spent an year in 2015 learning new things - Wordpress and Front end web development and consulting until I joined two childhood friends and we founded a game development company - <a href="http://play.victusgame.com">Victus Games</a>. For the first time in my career I was managing partner, head of marketing department, copywriter and graphic designer at the same time. <br><br>

            Running an independent game studio for two years teaches you a lot. I am almost sure I can write a book on how much I’ve learned about business, marketing, software development and life in the last three years. We’ve built a team of 10 people (2 of them were directly under me in Marketing dpt.), launched two betas and one Kickstarter campaign (failed), we built a community from scratch and learned hard lessons about business and life. <br><br>

            In early 2017 we launched the software development company <a href="http://solvedout.com">SolvedOut</a>, utilizing our talent, connections and knowledge and produced several software solutions for clients in Europe and USA.

            In late 2017 I couldn't resist the crypto hype and became interested in marketing for crypto projects. I advised an ICO and later I co-founded a small crypto consulting company.

                 Having learned quite a bit about the software development cycle, product management, MVPs and market validation, we decided to help people with ideas to come up with the right demo, MVP or even scale an existing application or idea.

                  We have so far released projects for clients in real estate, sports and entertainment. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                  My goal at the company was to promote its services, to grow our clients' base and to manage our projects with our development team. I researched the market, dug deeper in the customers' problems to refine the solution, collaborated with engineers and UX designers on the execution and guided our clients in the software development process.

                  I began my training in advertising at Archer Ideas in 2011 and gained valuable experience in ATL, BTL,Digital Advertising and Marketing. <br><br>

                  For almost three years, I  developed ATL, BTL and digital creative solutions for different clients from the automotive, FMCG and financial sectors.<br><br>

                  As one of my highest achievements I consider my work for the international acclaimed Diageo brand Johnnie Walker. I adapted, developed and managed the social media content for Johnnie Walker Bulgaria's Facebook Page, I took part in several 360-campaigns and devoted much of my time to the development of the brand in Bulgaria. I consider all my efforts dedicated to Johnnie Walker undoubtedly worthy and rewarding for my personal professional development.<br><br>

I believed that if people got out and ran a few miles every day, the world would be a better place, and I believed these shoes were better to run in. People, sensing my belief, wanted some of that belief for themselves.
                           Belief, I decided. Belief is irresistible.

                           <p> Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that 
                              other people can use.

                              Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.
